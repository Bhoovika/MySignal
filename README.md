Healthcare is one of the sectors that all nations are working to grow sustainably. Internet of Things, is a young technology that offers advancements and improved medical solutions. A significant application of cloud computing is helping doctors perform faster diagnostic procedures. Obtaining real-time data from medical sensors is another one of the main applications. Here, we have proposed a method in which we read patient data from the MySignals e-health platform, store it in the cloud, and conduct analysis on it. This project makes it possible for the doctor to monitor the patient's health from any location and provide recommendations for additional treatment by displaying that data in the cloud.
